        <p><b>Welcome to Wikipedia</b>,a collaborative project to produce a complete encyclopedia from scratch. We started in January 2001 and are already working on 49838 articles, with more being added and improved all the time. Anyone, including you, can edit any article right now, without even having to log in. You can copyedit, expand an article, write a little or write a lot. See the Wikipedia FAQ for more background information about the project, and the help page for information on how to use and contribute to Wikipedia.</p>
